# Data Exploration with Apache Drill

## Prerequisites
Drill uses standard ANSI SQL as its main user interface.  This course focuses on how to use Drill and not the details of SQL syntax so having a good understanding of SQL will help you with this class.  If you are looking for a good tutorial, I recommend *SQL for Mere Mortals* by John Viescas and Michael J. Hernandez which is available here: http://amzn.to/2lfhXNL.

### Required Software
For this class, I will provide you with a virtual machine with Drill and all the required software pre-configured.  I **highly** recommend using the virtual machine. The virtual machine needs 8GB of RAM and 30GB of hard disk space.  You will also need to:
* Download and install [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* Download and unzip the Griffon virtual machine here: http://bit.ly/griffon1  (You'll need 7-zip to unzip the VM)

If you are not using the VM, you will need to install Drill on your local machine.

## Code of Conduct

Since this is an official O'Reilly Training, we will adhere to the [O'Reilly conferences Code of Conduct](http://www.oreilly.com/conferences/code-of-conduct.html).

_"At O'Reilly, we assume that most people are intelligent and well-intended, and we're not inclined to tell people what to do. However, we want every O'Reilly conference to be a safe and productive environment for everyone. To that end, this code of conduct spells out the behavior we support and don't support at conferences."_
